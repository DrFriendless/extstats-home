So, this is Christmas.
I don’t know what Christmas is like for you, but it’s quiet for me these days.
My family lives interstate, my wife is not a Christian, and my idea of a good time is fixing bugs. So we spent Christmas at home and did very little.

However I did get a bit of a chance to work on the site. I managed to:

* remove deleted BGG users
* discover that one of the Lambdas I’ve been invoking apparently never existed (whut? maybe I got distracted before I finished it?)
* write a new email response for new users
* send email responses to 20 or 30 users
* added a “number of plays column” to the updates page, so you can compare the count to BGG easily
* fix the SSL certificate on the old server
* install a new kernel on the old server
* write a blog post so you know I’m not dead!

Tomorrow is also a holiday, although we will be having people over.
Maybe I will be able to ignore them and finish the new feature that I’ve had on my smaller laptop for about the last 3 months.
I wish that every day could be Christmas Day, where people do their own things and don’t hassle me… happy holidays, team!
