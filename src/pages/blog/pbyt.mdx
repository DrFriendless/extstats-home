Long-time site user Tom mentioned a feature from the old site that I hadn't yet reimplemented.
It was the one that answers the question "for your most-played games, what years did you play them in?"

My gaming fell in a ditch a few years ago, basically for the same reasons the site did.
But then we had the pandemic, which changed everything, and gave us all the glorious illusion that we would have spare time.
And after the pandemic came the puppy, and I feared I would never sit down again.

And anyway this table clearly shows the collapse in my gaming.
After the pandemic finished I had a regular game of Through the Ages, and after that fell through I did some Memoir '44,
and then it all got very sad.

These days, I couldn't tell you the rules to Eminent Domain.
But Vikings, I must play Vikings again!
I think the feature is doing its job!
