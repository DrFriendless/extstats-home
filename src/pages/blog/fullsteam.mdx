I’ve been beavering away on plays downloads.
There were a couple of bugs so the downloader was stuck for most of the week, but this afternoon I got it working properly (this time for sure), so I cranked up the pace.
I told the system to do 100 downloads per minute.
It had 231900 to do, so it’ll still take a while – maybe 4 days, unless there are more bugs.

Anyway, that’s to complete that job.
As some plays have already been downloaded, I’ve started populating the SdJ column in the War Table, and Total Plays in the Rankings table.

To populate the SdJ column I needed to know what the series were, so I coded up the bit that downloads the series metadata as well.
I’ve dumped the old Catan / Carcassonne / Command & Colours, etc series, as they were getting silly and nobody cares.
And if somebody does care I can put them back.

When the plays data is ready, I’ll get the War Table and the Rankings Table working properly, and then I’ll be in a position to implement some of the other features of the old system.
I have a plan in mind for constructing pages of features, which I will experiment with a bit when I have some features to do it with.

I hope it gets more fun after this.
I mean, it’s kinda fun for me to see it all coming together, but it’ll be better when it’s fun for you guys too. Here’s a pretty picture:
