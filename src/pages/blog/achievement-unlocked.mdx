Over summer, I was working towards a particular goal.
I mean the Australian summer, so that was more than 6 months ago now.
My plan was to put into the new site a feature that I had mocked up on the old site 2 years before.
However even then the old site was becoming difficult to work on.

I actually implemented the feature with the server in Kotlin, and the web page in AngularJS.
AngularJS has since died, and I am now using Angular 7 (which is sooooo much nicer!).
Kotlin is a language I do love, but the architecture of the server was so 2015, so that code could not continue to live in the serverless world.
And then when I did start writing serverless code, TypeScript on Node.js seemed like a better choice.

So anyway, what did I do?
Well, it’s just the Rate of Play of Games New to You, for multiple users (which the page could already do), but now it’s EASY TO USE!
So people can actually see that the page can do that.

I tried to add a few more people to the list, but I ran into a problem I haven’t encountered before – there was too much data for the Lambda to return!
It seems there’s a 6 megabyte limit.
After I return that data, it gets compressed before sending it back to the browser, to only about 10% of the original size, but the limit is before compression.

To tell the truth I’m a little nervous about the amount of data I send back, as it costs me money, so maybe it’s worth some work to make that data smaller.

This new feature is on the test system and is coming to the live system within 24 hours.
