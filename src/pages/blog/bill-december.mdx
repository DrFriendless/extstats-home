Sorry for the lack of updates.
Just before New Year I bought myself Assassin’s Creed: Origins for the PS4, and oh my goodness I have been playing a lot of that.
Today I’m making some time to look at Extended Stats, before I finish saving Cleopatra.

In the absence of having anything exciting to say, here’s the news on the latest bill.
It’s still higher than I want, but it shows promise.

The great news is that Lambda costs are zero.
Lambdas do a lot of work on the site, so getting them for free is good.
The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) costs are high, but that includes the costs for Elastic Beanstalk that I blogged about previously and will be much lower since I replaced that with a simple virtual machine.

The CloudWatch charge is another surprise – my graph of all of the lambdas being invoked started costing me money because there was too much stuff on it.

In other news, the database performance gets smoother and smoother, which is a great thing.

I’m continuing to try to get the login button to work properly. It’s very hard to test! I guess I should start adding some functionality some time soon.
