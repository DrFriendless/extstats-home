I need to start onboarding people to the new site, because some people have been waiting months for any acknowledgement from me that they can have stats.
And if I’m going to give users a site under development, I’d better at least have some way of telling them how that development is going.
So, there’s a blog.
I am not a very arty person so it’s likely to be a kinda clunky boring blog.

Anyway, this evening I’ve been working on getting some bugs out of the downloader.
Some people on the user list have deleted their BGG accounts, and the downloader was very confused about why they had no games.
So I had to get those people off the list and then get the downloader to delete them from the database.

I also added a dashboard so I can see which Lambda functions are giving errors.
That has been extremely useful.

For those who know about AWS, the blog is hosted on a teensy weensy EC2 instance.
So that bit is not serverless.
