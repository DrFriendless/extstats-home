I just remembered it was Friday - these short weeks are difficult - and so it was Finances Friday, it wasn't "Happily Adding New Features Day" as I had hoped.
I killed off the old blog server a couple of days ago so I was hoping for a nice number.

The good news is that costs are very low, although there was no sign of a decrease due to killing the blog server.
However there was this mysterious green lump in the graph.
It was only a lump of about $2 per day, but as I didn't ask for it I needed to investigate.

It was attributed to "EC2 Other", which is not a thing I remember buying.
A bit of investigation suggested that it was due to excess CPU usage.
Standard CPU usage for the EC2 (I only have one) is about 1%, so it was unusual that it was at about 50% for a few days.
I don't really get why I would be charged extra for using my CPU 50% of the time when I'm already paying for it, but I'm sure such things make sense in the AWS world.

Anyway, it seems to have been caused by the bug I posted about on Tuesday, as the timeline and symptoms match.
Oh well, I must stop putting bugs in.
At least my processes caught it fairly quickly.
