Last time I blogged I mentioned how frustrated I was with Vega.
Yesterday, Saturday, I had a look at the problem and I still had no idea.
So I posted a big description on reddit and went and walked the dog or something.
When I got back, a useful person had replied, but I couldn’t get what they were telling me.
After a bit more head scratching this morning, I finally figured it out and I got the plays page doing something.

<Image src={blackline} alt="Number of different games played over time graph" width={1024} />
<caption>Number of different games played over time, for Karlsen</caption>
<p/>

I’m claiming it mostly wasn’t my fault!
I thought that if I imported Vega it would import an appropriate set of sub-libraries.
Not at all, it imported an inconsistent set of sub-libraries.
So two versions of things I didn’t specify didn’t work with each other.
I am grumpy about that, but when it works Vega is so beautiful I’ll have to put up with it.

Not that this graph is particularly beautiful, yet.
I probably should have used a colour other than black for the line.
When I start adding more users, each line will be a different colour and rendered with a different symbol.

I’ve been working towards that goal for MONTHS.
After I got this much going, I had a look at how to get the geek buddy lists from the user data into this page.
Then I got stuck with another bug for way too long, because Angular doesn’t tell you the URL of the page you’re on…
and it doesn’t even say that it does, it’s just that it looks very much like it might, and that confuses a great many people.

So I’m continuing work on adding multiple users to this page.
It was very nice though to be able to add a news item to the news table in the database for the first time since September.
