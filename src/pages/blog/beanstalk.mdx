Woohoo, I got Elastic Beanstalk to work! The “Express & EB” sticky note has been removed!
Actually I got Elastic Beanstalk to work on about Tuesday, and today I’ve been learning more about getting Express to do stuff.

The first thing to do was a URL to find geeks with a particular partial name.
For example, http://eb.drfriendless.com/findgeeks/Fri will give you up to 10 geeks whose names start with “Fri”.
And http://eb.drfriendless.com/findgeeks/boy will give you up to 10 geeks whose names start with “boy”.
Because there are none, it will instead give you up to 10 geeks with “boy” somewhere in their name.
This is how autocomplete fields work, but I didn’t write the autocomplete field yet so I can’t show you what the plan is.
