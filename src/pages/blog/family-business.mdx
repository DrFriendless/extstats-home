Before I fall asleep, let me bash out a quick blog post so that you know I’m not dead.
Instead I have been occupied with visiting family, which is the next best thing.

I have been doing some work on the site, but it hasn’t turned into useful functionality yet.
I believe I’ve got the API for retrieving plays of games working, so next I have to produce a user interface which displays some of that data.
I did a little bit of work on that this evening before I had to drive somebody somewhere.

I’ve also been chatting with the guys from https://www.rollforgroup.com.
There are more of them than there are of me!
I met the head honcho there at a MongoDB meetup before I started this rewrite, and when you find another programmer obsessed with board games you’ve got to be friends with them, right?

I also got a couple of new Patreon patrons early this year, which was wonderful!
But that was exactly at the time that I went away for a week to play board games (including Gloomhaven, for the first time),
and then when I got back the Family Business started.
Now I remember why it took so many years for the old site to evolve to its current state.
