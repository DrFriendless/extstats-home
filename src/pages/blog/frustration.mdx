Sometimes it would be more fun to bang my head against a brick wall rather than be a programmer.
However programming pays better and I don’t have much experience in headbanging.
This is no time for a career change.

I managed to make some progress on the User page.
That’s the one you get to after you log in and click on your user name.
It seems that it can now store your BGG name and your buddy lists, and then display them again afterwards.
It has taken WAY TOO LONG to get that working.

I then continued work on the Plays page – the one that uses the data about all the games you’ve played.
I’m working on a chart to compare how many new games you’ve played when with the same for your buddies from a buddy list.
I’ve had the data gathering working for a few weeks, and I have just finished the chart.
Well, sort of.

The charting tool, Vega, is the most beautiful and argumentative contrary piece of shit software I’ve ever used.
After spending a couple of hours getting the chart to work in the debugger, I had to address why it didn’t work in the page.
My first idea was to upgrade some versions of some things.

That was a complete disaster.
Vega has internal conflicts, so now my code can’t compile and won’t run.
Using the latest versions of everything, it doesn’t work.
Using the same versions of everything from this morning, it doesn’t work.
I have turned it off and on again so many times… so now I’m bored and I’m going to go read a book instead.
This happens every time with Vega, I seem to be missing something.
