For the first time in many years I am not working over the Christmas-New Year period.
Usually at this time of year I'd be helping clients who are about to have New Year's parties avoid fraud.
I like catching fraudsters because it has more of an effect on the company's bottom line than most features I add!
But not this year, this year I am at home and the dog walker is on holidays, so Gray and I have been doing what he says (which is mostly going to the beach).

In my few spare minutes, I decided to take a break from the serious work and add a feature that I'd been itching to add - blog comments.
This is a feature I don't particularly need, but it does make having a user account more meaningful.
So without a great deal of forethought I started typing in a comments system.
Then after some time I realised I didn't know where I was going so I took the dog for a walk and thought about it and had another bash.
After a few iterations I think it has come out alright.

I'm releasing the first cut today, although there are definitely more features I want to add.
Howeever I don't like to leave features unreleased because after a while (i.e. a year or so) I forget what all those changes were and have to throw the code away.
So if all has gone to plan there will be a comments section at the bottom of this page.

Features which are still missing:
* provide the user with a list of all of their comments
* advise users that a comment has been replied to.

The second will require a general notification system, which is again probably more work than I imagine and will require several dog walks.

So why do I persist on rewriting features that WordPress already has, and that I could probably get from some third-party integration?
* WordPress comments sections are one of the greatest attractors of spam in the universe
* third-party integrations cost money
* a feature that I write comes out exactly how I want it.

Well anyway, enough rambling.
Inevitably, it is time to walk the dog.
