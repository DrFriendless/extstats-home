Some time ago – it was probably last year – I had a hardware failure on the old stats server in my study, and the site was down for a few weeks. During that time I did a thing I never wanted to do, and ported the old site into the cloud. That became stats3.drfriendless.com.

This has always been a problematic service, because:

* I never wanted to do it
* I hate the technology that it uses
* I can’t remember how the old site works
* The database is badly designed
* The site is slow
* It’s very expensive

And I could go on whining all day. But then add to that:

* The expensive service was underpowered for what I was trying to do
* And it didn’t work anyway and I couldn’t be arsed finding out why

so today I finally pulled the pin and shut it down. stats3.drfriendless.com now points to the same server as stats.drfriendless.com.

So now I am back down to two sites, both of which are cheaper. I won’t miss stats3, it was not a good solution.
