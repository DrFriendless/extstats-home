Well we had a very busy weekend.
DrMrsDrFriendless got home from a long overseas trip.
Then the next day it was Australia Day, Invasion Day, Indian Republic Day, Yarbun Festival, and Gray's birthday all at the same time.
And that meant that Monday was a public holiday.

So that makes today Tuesday, and I took a look at the Grafana dashboard to reassure myself that all was well with the system.

All was not well with the system.

The Files Awaiting Processing were not coming down, and the EB2 CPU was weirdly high.
That sounded very much like a bug in the server-side of the downloader (called Inside Q, by the way).

The recent changes to default base games, which I haven't even documented here yet, had broken when they encountered someone who didn't have a login, which is almost everyone.
Oh dear, that's what I get for releasing a feature in a hurry on a Friday afternoon.

It was a quick fix, and we were up and running again.
