My wife is an information science academic, meaning that she spends her time thinking about how people interact with information.
For example, what’s in your mind when you’re doing a Google search.
Or when the doctor tells you you have to stop smoking or you’ll die, what bit of that don’t you understand.
She talks about things like “affordances”, which means sort of “a thing that’s available for you to do things”, e.g. a button or a door handle.

So user experience is not an alien concept to me, but you wouldn’t know that given how crappy the site has been so far.
I’ve been doing that thing like a duck does, with a whole lot of furious activity under the water, while above the water the site has been serenely useless.
Today’s job was to address that.

During the week I got the geek page working.
Actually, no, that was this morning.
It’s been a long day.
The geek page is like this:

https://extstats.drfriendless.com/geek.html?geek=Friendless

It’s a page all about one BGG user.
It has links to various bits of the site, some of which I’ve even done and work properly.
So if you can get to the geek page, you can find your stats.

Then today I coded up an idea I had last night for the front page of the site (extstats.drfriendless.com).
It’s like a FAQ with stats. I think geeks will get it, and they’ll play with it, and be able to find the rest of the site.
If you have ideas for FAQs, please suggest them to me.

Also, calloo callay, I got the blasted login button to go to the right hand side of the page.
