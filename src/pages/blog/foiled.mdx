As it’s Monday morning and I’m supposed to be going to work, this one will be short.
I spent yesterday working on the autocomplete functionality, and after a great deal of mucking with Express security, I got it working.
It looks lovely! However then when I went to put it on the site, the application I use to copy all of my HTML and so on up to AWS just refused to do anything.
Computer says no.

That’s  the “fun” and frustration of this project.
The tech is pretty much bleeding edge, so stuff just fails quite often.
My test site, http://test.drfriendless.com, is completely broken at the moment!
