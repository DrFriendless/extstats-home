import Spinner from "./spinner.html";

I decided I needed a loading widget for the pages where a great deal of data needs to be loaded (i.e. all the useful ones).
So after copying some stuff and fiddling with it, I came up with this:

<Spinner/>

I kinda like it.
I like the colours.
If I knew anything about graphic design I’d know how to proceed from that to make a colour scheme for the site.

To the uninitiated, developing a web site like this is just all beer and coding and living the high life from the Patreon proceeds.
I have other responsibilities though!
I’m fully conscious that the site looks a bit amateur, but that’s because I am indeed an amateur in many aspects of web development.
I’ve been reading books about colour, and design – in the aesthetic sense, not in a how-to-do-it-in-HTML sense.
So I’m hoping that over time some sense of style will infect my brain, and I’ll apply it to the site.
