One of my favourite features on the old site is the Plays of Games Owned Graph.
I’ve been intending to put it on the new site for a long time, but have finally achieved it!
As far as I can recall it has all the same features as the old one, including the click-through to BGG.

This graph is now on the Owned page.
It’s available now on test.drfriendless.com, and tomorrow on extstats.drfriendless.com.
