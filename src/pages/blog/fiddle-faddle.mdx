I’ve been quiet for a couple of weeks, but I’ve been persistently working on the Plays by Month page.
I recently added a couple of tables to the Plays page, that should have been on Plays By Month, so I moved them across.
Of course it wasn’t quite a perfect match, and it turned out to be a lot more fiddly than I anticipated.
There are so many numbers!

For example, on that page the “plays for a month” could mean the plays in the month, the cumulative plays forever until that month, or the cumulative plays from the start of the year until that month.
There’s meant to be synergy between the tables, but it turns out there’s just complexity and confusion.
Anyway, it’s done now, and I can get onto some more interesting problems.

Those tables from the Plays page will eventually be removed and replaced with other things that use the data that the page has.
