I hate banking and I hate bills. Not because it’s money going out – I can cope with that – it just gives me anxiety.
I am forever doomed to be a programmer (or possibly a novelist) because I hate thinking about money and I hate doing banking.
This extends even to the email from AWS about the bills giving me anxiety.
That’s why I had 3 unread ones in my mailbox until today, and they are issued monthly.

Despite my personal issues, the bills were great news, as illustrated in drop in the graph above.
The database continues to cost a fixed amount (variations are due to varying numbers of days in the month), and the other costs are all dropping.
I could probably do even more about the EC2 costs now that I have the lambdas sorted, but I feel that I should get some functionality working on the site, for a change.
