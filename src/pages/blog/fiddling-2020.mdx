When I was writing the “Best Days in Gaming” table the other day, I realised that there were 3 parameters that I used which were sort of arbitrary.
And I also realised that it probably wouldn’t be too hard to allow users to change them – Angular is really good at that sort of stuff.

So last night I sat down and wrote the code, and I really liked how it turned out. It has gone live already so you can check it out.
I had to give the button to get to it a name, so I called it “Fiddle”.

And then today I decided I could do the same thing for a couple of other charts on that page, so now the Florence Nightingale diagram and the Most Played Games by Year chart have Fiddle buttons as well.
I think this will become a thing.

I think my next task in this direction should be saving the fiddled values to the user’s account (if you’re logged in).
That is the whole point of logging in, after all.
